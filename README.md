# b-card-wc
This a very basic card for a web component workshop I did for teaching.
So, basically this card receives parameters and outputs a styled component with the data you provided.

## Installation
Make sure you have Node/npm cli installed. Then, just type the following command:
```bash
$ npm install b-card-web-component
```

## Usage
Add a <b-card-web-component> element to your page and set the convenient parameters as attributes that the component needs in order to get styled a card.
For e.g:
```html
<b-card title="An example Card" description="This is a example of a styled card!" />
```
> Above element will show a card centered at your page, likewise you can custom the styles

So that's it!

Hope you enjoy and makes me happy you contribute to this component, just make me a pull request with your desired features for the card. ðŸ§¡
